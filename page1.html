<a href="2010/12/07/blog-refactorings-with-symfony2-doctrine-2-and-zeta-components.html"><h1>Blog Refactorings with Symfony2, Doctrine 2 and Zeta Components</h1></a>
<p>I have been playing around with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony-reloaded.org">Symfony 2</a> quite a lot lately and have rewritten this blog using Symfony 2, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine 2</a> and Zeta Components. You can go over to Github and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/Whitewashing">find its project page</a>.</p>
<p>Since I have found <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/index.html">Sphinx</a> I am pretty impressed with Restructured Text and have now integrated that as writing language into my backend. Using <a class="reference external" href="http://zetacomponents.org/">Zeta Components</a> excellent Document component I transform the written ReST to XHTML. I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/Whitewashing/tree/master/Util/DocumentVisitor">hooked into the Document rendering</a> and it now supports using the Sphinx directive ”.. code-block:: &lt;language&gt;” and runs the subsequent code through Geshi for highlighting. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello world with ReST and Zeta Components!&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using <a class="reference external" href="http://teddevito.com/demos/textarea.html">the jQuery Plugin Tabby</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/">MarkitUp with a ReST extension</a> I can also write more conveniently now. Also to battle spam I have moved the comment system to Disqus.</p>
<p>My next plans for the blog bundle are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>WebDav support for authoring. All articles will be named “slug.inputformat”, for example “blog-refactorings-with-symfony2-doctrine2-zetacomponents.rst”. For this I plan to write a custom backend for ezcWebdav.</li>
<li>Making the Bundle simpler to re-use by others.</li>
<li>More jQuery love to the backend.</li>
<li>Trigger some events in the blog post cycle and hook a twitter + facebook notification for new posts in there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Btw: This blog post is really just a bad excuse for me to test the ReST Editor in the backend. I hope you still enjoyed it ;)</p>

<a href="2009/02/25/git-is-great-helping-out-with-mutateme.html"><h1>Git is great: Helping out with MutateMe</h1></a>
<p>These last days I had fun with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/padraic/mutateme/tree">Padraic Bradys
MutateMe</a> project. It
dynamically changes your code (using PECL Runkit extension) and checks
weather your test cases fetch the errors occurring from changing the
source code. This is a great addition to having a test suite, because it
finds all the problematic test cases, that try to do too much and fail
to cover the code correctly.</p>
<p>I have also contributed to the MutateMe project already and this was
only possible due to Git and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, which
makes contributing to any project easy like writing a hello world
example in a random programing language. As such I have to agree with
Padraic: <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/390-Mutation-Testing-MutateMe-0.2.0alpha-Released.html">I love Git,
too!</a>
He already integrated my and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpunit.de">Sebastians</a>
changes back into the master and we didn’t have to focus on merging,
communication and integration alot.</p>
<p>My <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree/master">PUMA project</a> is also
hosted on GitHub (although nobody has looked into that yet), but I am
beginning to write a complete Runner now that calls all three components
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pdepend.org">PDepend</a>
and CodeSniffer at once and directly processes the results. When this is
done, I will pack it all up as a PEAR package for anyone to test out.</p>

<a href="2009/02/08/unittest-and-metrics-aggregator-tool-for-php.html"><h1>Unittest and Metrics Aggregator Tool for PHP</h1></a>
<p>Both <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http:/www.pdepend.org">PDepend</a> offer export functionality in XML or
in a Test-database that is not quite readable for any user from the
start. Over the last month I have gradually written <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.github.com/beberlei/puma">a nice webbased
tool</a>, that aggregates this data
and (todo in the future) relates them to help me with my open source
projects.</p>
<p>PHPUnit can be used with a <strong>–test-db-dsn</strong> command, which saves all
information about tests into a Database and PDepend has a strong Package
centric source parser for all sorts of project metrics.</p>
<p>What I needed for my <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>
related work (and other projects) was a tool that does a run of the
complete test-suite for me and saves the information, so that I can see
where problems occur (and if they are due to my changes or other
peoples). Since PHPUnit will stopped calculating additional metrics, I
have also integrated the fabulous PDepend Tool into this aggregator. It
shows me, what classes and functions need refactoring due to complexity
issues and draws some nice graphs that summarize all sorts of project
related information on a per package basis.</p>
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.github.com/beberlei/puma">download or clone the an alpha version at
Github</a>. Its written with
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ezcomponents.org">ezcMvcTools</a>, so you need this to work
too. A list of <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.github.com/beberlei/puma">some screenshots is at the Github Wiki

<a href="2009/02/13/update-on-unittest-and-metrics-tool.html"><h1>Update on Unittest and Metrics Tool</h1></a>
<p>Some days ago i posted about the <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree/master">PHP Unittest and Metrics
Aggregator</a> tool that i
have written on (and which I have dubbed PUMA). Discussing it with
people I came to the conclusion that the approach using
<a class="reference external" href="http://ezcomponents.org">ezcMvcTools</a> is quite problematic that it
forces to use this application, although the reporting and the
application are quite separate. This is not against ezcMvcTools: I love
it, its just the wrong type of support.</p>
<p>I began to split up the aggregator into some sort of importing-exporting
tool. You can specify library-, test- and output-directory of your
application and it will use the tools at hand
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pdepend.org">PDepend</a>
and CodeSniffer currently) to generate their XML formatted reports. It
then parses those XML outputted files and combines their result to give
a consistent view on your application.</p>
<p>The Import-To-Output generator uses a three-step approach. An importer
emits signals to report observers, which will then hand over their
collected data to specific html pages that are then generated to the
disc. This is a very flexible approach that allows anyone to extend and
re-use the tool to generate project metrics, unittest overview and other
interesting details on your application.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/puma/tree/master">Have a look at the tool on
Github</a> and play with it.
I would really like to hear your thoughts.</p>

<a href="2009/05/01/explicit-code-requires-no-comments-only-bad-code-does.html"><h1>Explicit Code requires no comments - Only bad code does</h1></a>
<p>Following the recent discussion on commenting source code by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.brandonsavage.net/on-code-commenting-and-technical-debt/">Brandon
Savage</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://mtabini.blogspot.com/2009/04/myth-of-myth-of-self-commenting-code.html">Marco
Tabini</a>,
I wanted to add upon Marcos code example to show that it not even needs
any inline comments and can be greatly enhanced in readability with
taking 2-5 minutes of time and refactoring the code. The original code
sample was:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>function __construct(array $pathInfo) {
    $section = $pathInfo[0];
    $file = $pathInfo[1];

    // Assume that the location of this file is inside the main trunk, and that pathInfo has already been filtered.

    $path = dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../' . $section . '/xml/static/' . $file . '.xml';

    if (!file_exists($path)) {
        Controller::singleton()-&gt;doError(404);
    }

    parent::__construct('main/xsl/template.xsl', $path);
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This sample is somehow related to the response and view rendering of an
application and its pretty understandable. For me there are some squirks
though that would make me have to scroll to other classes to see how
they interact. For example the path information falls from heaven. Why
is it an array of 2 values and are these sections set the same all the
time? And what exactly happens when the front controller does the 404
error? Is there a die() or exit in the <strong>doError()</strong></p>
<p>The Agile movement postulates the phase of refactoring for a finished
piece of code. Rebuilding the hacked solutions that did it to make them
more understandable. I applied this to Marcos code snippet. The
refactoring produces about double the code, but its done entirely by
using NetBeans nice Rename variable and copy paste on extracting
methods, which takes not more than 5 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class StaticXmlXsltRendererImpl extends AbstractXsltView
{
    function render(array $filteredPathInfo) {
        $templateValuesXmlPath = $this-&gt;getTemplateValuesXmlFile($filteredPathInfo);

        if(!$this-&gt;templateExists($templateValuesXmlPath)) {
            Controller::singleton()-&gt;doError(404);
        } else {
            parent::render('main/xsl/template.xsl', $templateValuesXmlPath);
        }
    }

    private function getTemplateValuesXmlFile($filteredPathInfo) {
        $section = $this-&gt;getSection($filteredPathInfo);
        $file = $this-&gt;getFile($filteredPathInfo);

        // Assume that the location of this file is inside the main trunk
        return dirname(__FILE__) . '/../../' . $section . '/xml/static/' . $file . '.xml';
    }


    private function getSection($pathInfo) {
        return $pathInfo[0];
    }

    private function getFile($pathInfo) {
        return $pathInfo[1];
    }

    private function templateExists($path) {
        return file_exists($path);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this code snippet the class name, variable names and methods clearly
communicate what is done, which wasn’t the case in the previous example.
The only change for the clients is the change of using the constructor
to using the <strong>render()</strong> method, which communicates the intend more.
Also the render method now clearly communicates that either the error or
the parent rendering is executed and leaves no doubt about it.</p>
<p>The <strong>getTemplateValuesXmlFile()</strong> method still uses the comment to show
the assumption about relative pathes, but this is only the case because
application configuration is made implicit into the code. This has to be
extracted to be an explicit configuration constant and the comment can
go.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>private function getTemplateValuesXmlFile($filteredPathInfo) {
    $section = $this-&gt;getSection($filteredPathInfo);
    $file = $this-&gt;getFile($filteredPathInfo);

    return APPLICATION_ROOT . '/' . $section . '/xml/static/' . $file . '.xml';
}</pre>
</div>
<p>In my opinion commenting code is necessary only for non-refactored
code that has been hacked into existence and is hard to understand.
Either the programmer has to get it done and has no chance to
clearly communicate the intend. Or what is even worse the to be
changed legacy code is hard to understand but you can’t take the
chances to refactor it because its also already in production and
has no tests. Now from the second point it is obvious that upon ugly
code you put only more and more ugly code to fix the problems. This
is what leads to the legacy maintenance problems that pretty much
every programmer faces. And then commenting comes into play: You
have to add a new feature X and it has to be done fast. You don’t
really understand the code or how it works together but you know you
can put the new code for the feature into existence but its really
unintuitive. So you begin to comment it excessively, because its the
only way to clearly show its intend.</p>
<p>There are two mindestting factors that help to write code that is
understandable without having to excessivly comment it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>From the beginning, do not write code for the computer but for
developers. Changing this attitude really helps to write
understandable code like the one above.</li>
<li>Only leave code better than it was before, never worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are five technical practices that - when followed - allow to
write clearly communicating code from the beginning:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Giving classes, variables and methods good names. This is a
no-brainer but few people seem to follow it anyways.</li>
<li>Following the object-oriented <strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>
by never giving a class more than one responsibility. Macros
example seems to follow this one.</li>
<li>Methods should never switch in the level of detail. Micro-work at
the datastructure level should never be mixed with macro level
delegation to executing large chunks of code. Macros code
violates this by mixing the path building micro-level work with
the macro-level work of rendering the XSLT template. The path
building code can be hidden behind a method to communicate intend
more clearly.</li>
<li>Exchange if conditions with private methods that explain the
condition being checked for. In Marcos example this is not really
necessary, because file_exists already is quite a good
description to the condition. But in cases of logical
combinations of conditions the method extracting is a superior
way to explain the conditions intend without having to write a
comment.</li>
<li><strong>Seperate Query and Command</strong>: A method never should do a query
which returns the state of an object and a command which executes
a set of rules on the state.</li>
</ol>
<p>These practices sum up to one guideline: Make code explicit. This
obviously requires less commenting since a comment of explicit code
would be duplication and duplication is bad. What if you have a
project that does not follow this guidelines? Then of course
comments should be used to explain code, but in the long run this
should be refactored to self-explaining code. Additionally every new
feature should be programmed explicitly to follow the “leave code
better than before” principle.</p>
<p>In my opinion two refactoring tools are missing that would greatly
help PHP programmers write nice to read code: Extract method and
Replace magic value with constant. Can someone integrate them into
NetBeans please?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Fixed a creepy copy-paste code bug, thanks to azeroth
for pointing out. Moved methods around a bit to be more reading
friendly.</p>

instantiation and dependency tracking from the business logic.</p>
<p>Beginning with version 1.8 Zend Framework is able to integrate any of
these DI containers into its <strong>Zend_Application</strong> component easily. The
Application component intializes a set of common resources and pushes
them into the MVC stack as additional Front Controller parameters.
Technically a <strong>Zend_Registry</strong> instance holds all these resources with
their respective resource names as keys. The resources are accessible
inside the Front Controller and the Action Controller classes. Assume
the resource ‘Db’ is initialized in your application, you can access it
with:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
$container = $front-&gt;getParam('bootstrap')-&gt;getContainer();
$db = $container-&gt;db;

// or:
class FooController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    public function barAction()
    {
        $container = $this-&gt;getInvokeArg('bootstrap')-&gt;getContainer();
        $db = $container-&gt;db;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is pretty much dependency injection already, but the default
registry approach suffers from two serious problem: New instances can
only be added to the Container by implementing new Zend_Application
resources and these instances cannot be lazy loaded. All resources used
by Zend_Application are always loaded on every request. But the
application container implementation was developed with Dependency
Injection in mind and is not tied to the use of Zend_Registry. Only
three magic methods are required by any container that wants to be
Zend_Application compliant: __get(), __set() and __isset(). Each
instantiated resource is pushed via __set() into the container. If
required by another resource, __isset() is used to check wheater a
resource with the given name exists inside the container and __get()
is used to retrieve the instances from the container.</p>
<p>Some month ago I extended
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/beberlei/yadif/tree/master">Yadif</a>, a lightweight
PicoContainer-like DI container for PHP written by Thomas McKelvey, with
several features that make it a very powerful DI container in my
opinion. It has a detailed documentation and examples on the GitHub Page
if you want to check it out. I extended Yadif to be Zend_Application
compliant in a way that the application-wide Zend_Application resources
can be used as dependencies for objects that are lazy-loaded from the
container. Skipping the tech-talk, here is an example. First we have to
replace the default Container with Yadif:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>$objects = new Zend_Config_Xml(APPLICATION_PATH.&quot;/config/objects.xml&quot;);
$container = new Yadif_Container($objects);

$application = new Zend_Application(
    APPLICATION_ENV,
    APPLICATION_PATH . '/config/application.xml'
);
// Set Yadif as Container
$application-&gt;getBootstrap()-&gt;setContainer($container);
$application-&gt;bootstrap()
            -&gt;run();</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Assume you run Zend_Application with a “Db” and a “Cache” resource.
These resources are loaded on every request. The objects configured in
Yadif however are not instantiated until they are requested for the
first time from the container. We can merge these two worlds and make
use of the Application resources inside the Yadif Configuration
“objects.xml”, which looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;objects&gt;
    &lt;myModel&gt;
        &lt;class&gt;MyModel&lt;/class&gt;
        &lt;arguments arg1=&quot;db&quot; arg2=&quot;cache&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/myModel&gt;
&lt;/objects&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>Instantiating a <strong>myModel</strong> class inside the Action Controller uses
the the Database and Cache resources as constructor arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class FooController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    public function barAction()
    {
        $container = $this-&gt;getInvokeArg('bootstrap')-&gt;getContainer();
        $myModel = $container-&gt;myModel;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Given the possibilites by the Yadif_Container you are now empowered
to use Dependency Injection for all your application objects and
make use of Zend_Applications resource system. Furthermore any
other dependency injection container, simple or complex, can also be
integrated easily.</p>

<p>Just two days before the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.phpconference.de">International PHP Conference
09</a> will start I got an email from
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/alexandrehaguiar">alexandrehaguiar</a> that he forked
my Netbeans PHP CodeSniffer plugin and added the long awaited Options
screen. This is just awesome! This way I don’t have to ask the Netbeans
guys at IPC all the questions about how to implement it. I merged the
changes back into my branch and released a new version which also fixed
another small bug. For me it works with both Netbeans 6.7.1 and 6.8
Beta. I want to thank alexandre very much for this awesome contribution.</p>
<p>What you can do now is chose the Coding Standard you want to use in an
Options Dialog under the “Miscallenous” button. You can choose from a
list of pre-defined standards, or even enter your own if you use one.
Additionally you can disable that warning are shown, so that with any
given coding standard you only see the errors.</p>

<a href="2009/08/31/enums-in-php.html"><h1>Enums in PHP</h1></a>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://blog.tobias-olry.de">A colleague of mine</a> complained about the
missing support for Enums in PHP and how one often wants to have a
variable that is constant and has one of several specific values. We
came up with an elegant solution that we want to share, maybe its even
helpful to you.
If you want to implement Enum behaviour with a simple string or int
value you end up with having to validate the values at several different
locations in the code rather than being able to strictly enforce the
Enum structure by using typehints.</p>
<p>We discussed several approaches to this problem that all seemed a bit
ugly in one or another way. For example the <strong>SplEnum</strong> class is a step
in the right direction, however you can only use a type hint for
“SplEnum” or add another inheritance layer. Also you have to implement
different classes for each enum type, which requires you to implement a
factory method for your enum to help with creation of the different
types.</p>
<p>We came up with a very simple Enum concept. It uses reflection in the
constructor to check if the given value is a valid Enum value by
checking it against all the defined constants of the implementing class
and throws an Exception if it is not. The __toString() magic method is
implemented to allow for simple checks of the enums value. Strict
type-checks are not possible with this construct, however in our opinion
it is a very elegant solution to enforce a limited set of specific
values throughout your code-base.</p>
<p>Here is the code plus a small example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>abstract class MyEnum
{
    final public function __construct($value)
    {
        $c = new ReflectionClass($this);
        if(!in_array($value, $c-&gt;getConstants())) {
            throw IllegalArgumentException();
        }
        $this-&gt;value = $value;
    }

    final public function __toString()
    {
        return $this-&gt;value;
    }
}

class Foo extends MyEnum
{
    const FOO = &quot;foo&quot;;
    const BAR = &quot;bar&quot;;
}

$a = new Foo(Foo::FOO);
$b = new Foo(Foo::BAR);
$c = new Foo(Foo::BAR);

if($a == Foo::FOO) {
    echo &quot;My value is Foo::FOO\n&quot;;
} else {
    echo &quot;I dont match!\n&quot;;
}

if($a == $b) {
    echo &quot;a value equals b value!\n&quot;;
}
if($b == $c) {
    echo &quot;b value equals c value!\n&quot;;
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now you could nice things such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>function doStuff(Foo $foo) {
    switch($foo) {
        case Foo::FOO:
            echo &quot;do more here!\n&quot;;
            break;
        case Foo::BAR;
            echo &quot;evil stop!\n&quot;;
            break;
    }
}

doStuff($a);</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>

<a href="2009/01/23/zend-form-and-the-model-yet-another-perspective-using-a-mediator.html"><h1>Zend_Form and the Model: Yet another perspective using a Mediator</h1></a>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/">Matthew Weier O’Phinney</a> of the
Zend Framework Devteam <a class="reference external" href="http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/200-Using-Zend_Form-in-Your-Models.html">wrote a controversial post on integrating
Zend_Form and the Model last
month</a>.
He separated concerns of view and model that communicate via a Form, by
calling just thee validation functions on the Form inside the mode. On
request you could retrieve the model to the controller and view layers.
I already wrote into his comments that I didn’t like the solution
because it relys on implicit rules for the developers to use the Form
component correctly in all layers. Additionally the building of the form
using this approach would be performed inside the model, although
strictly speaking this is responsibility of the View Layer. Another
negative point is duplication of input filtering code that has to be
performed to use certain variables inside the controller or when
different forms talk with the same model.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://codeutopia.net">Jani</a> took it up and <a class="reference external" href="http://codeutopia.net/blog/2009/01/07/another-idea-for-using-models-with-forms/">proposed writing
validators for forms and attaching them to the
Form</a>
as sort of a mediator. I am not a fan of this approach either, because
the validator would have to include domain logic but is not really a
part of the domain logic anymore but just a validator. Developers might
forget using the validator inside the model for all their actions or
there would be duplication of code in some places. In a perfect world,
only functions of the models public interface should be called for
validation.</p>
<p>My personal favorite for Form and Model integration is a <strong>mediator</strong>
object between the two layers. Your model will have to include an
additional interface with one function <strong>acceptFormRequest($values);</strong>
which accepts an array of validated Zend Form field values. It then
tries to apply the validated data into a record. Additional required
validations of the model can take place in this function, which
separates the concerns of Form validation and Model data validation.
Still the mediator merges those differences together: You can throw an
Exception and it will be attached as a custom error message to the Form.
The following very short code will show the required interface and the
mediator code. This code is very simple and might produce maintenance
overhead fast, but I propose some refactoring enhancements later in the
discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>interface WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest
{
    /**
     * Acceept a form request
     * @param array $values
     * @return WW_Record_Interface
     */
    public function acceptFormRequest($values);
}
class WW_Model_FormMediator
{
    /**
     * Try to push the form request to the model
     *
     * @param Zend_Form $form
     * @param WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest $model
     * @return WW_Record_Interface
     */
    public function pushFormToModel(Zend_Form $form, WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest $model)
    {
        if(!$form-&gt;isValid()) {
            throw new Exception(&quot;Form not valid!&quot;);
        } else {
            $values = $form-&gt;getValues();
            try {
                $record = $model-&gt;acceptFormRequest($values);
            } catch(Exception $e) {
                // This exception message comes from the model, because validation failed
                $form-&gt;addErrorMessage($e-&gt;getMessage());
                throw new Exception(&quot;Form request not accepted by model!&quot;);
            }
        }
        return $record;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can see the mediator has two different stages where errors can
occour: When the form is not valid or the model is not valid. Both exits
can be catched inside the controller and are the indicator that the form
has to be displayed again for further input corrections. When successful
the model returns a valid record that applies to the form and model
requirements and can be displayed. If this record should be persistent
this would have been done inside the <strong>acceptFormRequest</strong> function
already. An example using a very simple Model using the a BankAccount
example. We have a form that validates all the incoming request data for
a withdrawel of money, though does not validate it against the models
internal state. Our BankAccountModel implements the
<strong>WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest</strong> interface and returns a valid
BankAccount. If found the given amount is withdrawn.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class BankAccountModel implements WW_Model_AcceptFormRequest {
    public function acceptFormRequest($values)
    {
        $bankAccount = $this-&gt;getBankAccountBy($values['bankAccountNumber'], $values['pin']);
        if($values['action'] == &quot;withdraw&quot;) {
            $bankAccount-&gt;withdraw($values['amount']);
            $this-&gt;save($bankAccount);
        } else {
            // unknown action...
        }
    }
    public function getBankAccountBy($key, $password) {
        // Find by Primary Key returning 'BankAccount' instance or exception if not found.
    }
    public function save(BankAccount $ba) {
        // Sql for saving the Bank Account
    }
}

class BankAccount
{
    public function withdraw($amount)
    {
        if( ($this-&gt;getBalance()-$amount) &lt; 0 ) {
            throw new Exception(&quot;You cannot withdraw more money than your bank account holds!&quot;);
        }
        $this-&gt;balance -= $amount;
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Two exceptions might be thrown in this case: The Bank Account number
does not exist or the password is wrong. Or you are not allowed to
withdraw the given amount of money. If any of those exceptions is thrown
the Model does not accept the form data and the form will have to be
displayed again for the client showing the new error message that was
returned from the model. The controller handling this process would lool
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-python"><pre>class BankAccountController extends Zend_Controller_Action {
    public function performWithdrawlAction() {
        $form = new BankAccountWithdrawlForm(); // extends Zend_Form and builds the form

        if($this-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;isPost()) {
            $mediator         = new WW_Model_FormMediator();
            $bankAccountModel = new BankAccountModel();
            try {
                $bankAccount = $mediator-&gt;pushFormToModel($form, $bankAccountModel);

                $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('bankAccount', $bankAccount); // Show new balance in view!
            } catch(Exception $e) {
                $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('withdrawlForm', $form);
                $this-&gt;_redirect('showWithdrawl');
            }
        } else {
            $this-&gt;view-&gt;assign('withdrawlForm', $form);
            $this-&gt;_redirect('showWithdrawl');
        }
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can see the mediator tightly integrates Form and Model without both
components knowing too much of each other. Still you can add error
messages recieved from the model into the Form and redisplay it. One
negative point of this approach is the fact that you only have one
method for accepting form data, which could result in variable checking
and redispatching in the case of many different operations that can be
performed on the same model. For this case you might want to either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Rewrite the mediator to accept a specific model class (not the
interface) and call the required custom method that matches the forms
request. (Best approach for separation concerns)</li>
<li>Rewrite the mediator to also pass the <strong>get_class($form);</strong> value to
the model for decision making (Faster approach)</li>
</ol>
<p>There is still some overhead on using the mediator. Since its generic
you could build an Action Helper for it and use the direct call
mechanism to save some lines of code.</p>

<p>There was this <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1688">lurking bug in
Zend_Mail</a> which
destroyed every Mail-Header (and corresponding Mail) with non US-ASCII
Chars and more than an encoded length of 74 chars. This is quite a huge
subset of mails, but it seems a nice solution was not so easy, at least
nobody tried to fixed it for quite some time.</p>
<p>Where many hackish solutions we’re offered, Ota Mares aka Littlex spent
incredible time to hunt the original problem down and with his help I
tag-teamed the bug to death today. Saturo Yoshida of Zend Fame added
some further spice regarding an alternative solution with Base64
Encoding instead of Quoted Printable Mime Header encoding.</p>
<p>In the end the solution we chose was, not to re-use the Mime encoding
function that is specific to MIME bodies according to
<a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045">RFC2045</a>, but to write a
completely new algorithm for Mime Headers, whose rules are specified in
<a class="reference external" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047">RFC2047</a>. This is now done and
unit-tests prove its working according to standard.</p>
<p>What is missing now is people trying that fix on as many Mail platforms
as possible and <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-1688">giving feedback in the
issue</a> if a lengthy
subject with non-ASCII chars is displayed correctly.</p>
