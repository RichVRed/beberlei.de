<h1><a href="2012/09/04/using_assertions_for_validation.html">Using Assertions for validation</a></h1>
<p>We all know PHP is weakly typed and has some weird type-conversion rules.
This can often complicate our code checking for invalid or illegal data.
Using if/else clauses we can do all sorts of validation, but with standard
coding styles (PSR, Zend, PEAR) we end up with at least 3 lines per check,
cluttering the whole code-base.</p>

<p>The rest of this components public API methods look about the same. It is a
very complete validation of the input data, however its not very readable.
Instead you have 6 if branches, which increase the complexity of the method
and almost take up half the screen without even getting to the actual code.</p>
<p>The assertion pattern is really helpful here to reduce the complexity of this
code and hide the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if/throw</span></span> conditions into little helper methods. Have a
look at a refactored method using my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/assert">Assert</a> micro-library.</p>

<p>This is much more readable, using two custom assertions and some general
assertions.</p>
<p>There is one risk here though, you introduce additional coupling to another
library/namespace. Especially when you start using this pattern on a large
scale, you have to make sure this assertions are <strong>VERY</strong> stable and
unit-tested.</p>
<p>That is why you should extend from <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Assertion</span></span> and use your own class when
using the Assert library. This returns some control in your hands and even
allows you to overwrite the exception class:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<h1><a href="2012/08/26/symfony__monolog_and_different_log_types.html">Symfony, Monolog and different log types</a></h1>
<p>Symfony uses the excellent Monolog library for logging everything related
to the symfony application stack. But sometimes you need a different logger
that responds differently to the log error levels. Ideally you don’t want
to reuse the application log mechanism to avoid messing with the
fingers crossed listener of Monolog, that keeps the application log files small
in case no errors occur.</p>
<p>This can be easily done with Symfonys MonologBundle with a feature called
channel. Every log handler, such as file, syslog, mail or
fingers crossed is attached to the default logger called “app”. This is
referenced by the dependency injection service called <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">monolog.logger</span></span>.</p>
<p>If you want to create a different logger service that is responsible for a
different type of your application stack, just define it using the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">channels</span></span>
option:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml"><div class="highlight"><pre>monolog:
    handlers:
        myfile:
            type: stream
            path: %kernel.logs_dir%/myfile.log
            channels: mychannel
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To actually write to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mychannel</span></span> you have to tag all the services that use
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mychannel</span></span> with the following tag:</p>
<div class="highlight-xml"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;service</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;my_service&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;MyService&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;tag</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;monolog.logger&quot;</span> <span class="na">channel=</span><span class="s">&quot;mychannel&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;argument</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;service&quot;</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;logger&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/service&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this approach you are now as flexible as with the default channel <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">app</span></span>
regarding to logging in development, testing and production environments for
example. Once there is a channel created through the DIC tag, you can actually
fetch it from the DIC with <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">monolog.logger.mychannel</span></span> in our example.
I don’t like this approach too much, because it misuses tags for modifying
arguments, where tags are actually for the services themselves. However it is
usable and works.</p>
<p>This feature is included starting with Symfony 2.1. It is <a class="reference external" href="http://symfony.com/doc/master/cookbook/logging/channels_handlers.html">documented in a
cookbook entry</a>,
however some insights of this blog post are still inside a pending Pull
Request.</p>

<h1><a href="2012/08/26/froscon_2012.html">FrOSCon 2012</a></h1>
<p>This years <a class="reference external" href="http://www.froscon.org">Free and Open Source Conference (FrOSCon)</a> took place this weekend in Bonn, St.  Augustin.
Because I live in Bonn, visiting the conference is a given for very many years
now. This year I also did a talk on “Architecture Design Patterns” with <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/go_oh">Gordon</a> so there was an incentive to show up besides
meeting friends, all the Club Mate and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.quijote-kaffee.de">good open source coffee</a>.</p>
<p>The most interesting topic in this years conference for me has been the <a class="reference external" href="http://graylog2.org">Graylog2</a> talk by Lennart Koopmann. Graylog is a logging server
that uses Elastic Search for persistence and searching. It is sponsored by
Xing, a pretty big german based Linkedin clone.</p>
<p>The talk <a class="reference external" href="http://programm.froscon.de/2012/events/954.html">The State of PHPUnit</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/__edorian">Volker</a> was interesting to see all the new stuff in
PHPUnit 3.7 and that it fixes a bunch of annoyances that I stumbled on myself.
I actually realized that they are so deeply rooted in my brain already, that
they constitute features for me, not something that could actually be
optimized. Well done to Volker and Sebastian to the new version.</p>
<p>Igors talk about building an HTTP server in PHP was interesting to see the
stream/socket server APIs of PHP at work. Ever since I took part in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/conradmueller/maexchen">the
SoCraTes 2012 Conference Maexchen UDP Bot</a> challenge I think network
programming is an interesting topic for learning about languages and
programming itself.</p>
<p>Volker did a second talk on sunday about Clean Code that was both entertaining
and interesting. He was reminding the audience that shipping the code is what
actually creates the value in our profession. Hence clean code is not about
the beauty of code itself, but its ability to be shippable, changeable and
adaptable to the business.</p>
<p>Again FrOSCon 2012 was awesome. Thank you very much especially to all the
volunteers that organized this event. It really good event to bring together
people from many different open-source communities and I already look forward
to the next FrOSCon 2013.</p>

<h1><a href="2012/08/25/decoupling_applications_with_domain_events.html">Decoupling applications with Domains Events</a></h1>
<p>In the <a class="reference external" href="http://whitewashing.de/2012/08/18/oop_business_applications__command_query_responsibility_seggregation.html">previous posts</a>
I have described 3 architectural patterns for business applications. Applying
them to your software helps you decouple the business logic from the
application/framework/UI. However given sufficient complexity, you will want to
decouple different parts of your business model from each other as well.</p>
<p>As an example, lets think of a batch process in your application that updates
orders from a CRM or logistics system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You receive an XML with full users and order representations</li>
<li>You need to update certain user fields</li>
<li>You need to update certain order fields</li>
<li>Some orders require creating accounts in different remote systems</li>
<li>If the user has not confirmed his email yet he should receive an opt-in
mail instead.</li>
<li>If the user confirms his opt-in mail, all outstanding remote accounts are
created.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can build all the steps into a single batch processing service. This will
be a particularly huge service and in violation of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility
principle</a>.</p>
<p>the part with updating of users and fields has nothing to with the sending of
mails and creation of remote accounts.  We want to decouple them from each
other.</p>
<p>The first obvious choice is to decouple them into distinct services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Import Service</li>
<li>Authentication Service</li>
<li>Account Generation Service</li>
</ul>
<p>All these services have dependencies on infrastructure objects, database,
mailer and so on. We could inject the authentication and account generation
services into the Import Service, but with rising complexity this will lead to
a lasagna of services and the execution path will dig deep into this and this
is not nearly as tasty as eating real lasagna.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ImportService
|_AuthenticationService
| |_Mailer
| |_Database
|_AccountGenerationService
| |_Database
| \_RemoteFacade
\_Database
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This becomes more complicated when transaction semantics need to be taken care
of. For example dependencies between mailer and database services. Also you
have to take into account that the code in entities and value objects
participating in this use-case.</p>
<p>What we want instead is a sequential execution of those nested services, but
only if the parent service executed successfully:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ImportService
\_Database

AuthenticationService
|_Mailer
\_Database

AccountGenerationService
|_Database
\_RemoteFacade
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We could use an event dispatcher in all of the services to notify each other,
but the <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/DomainEvent.html">DomainEvent pattern</a> does this more in a much
cleaner way:</p>
<p>Every entity is an event provider and can emit events. Whenever a transaction
is committed and an hence an operation is completed successfully, we take all
the events emitted from all entities (looking at the identity map for example)
and trigger observing event handlers. However if the operation fails, we do not
trigger these event handlers.</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The Event provider trait aggregates all the events, and offers
and API for external services to pull them from the entity:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">trait</span> <span class="nx">EventProvider</span>

        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">emittedEvents</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$event</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">dequeueEmittedEvents</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$events</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">emittedEvents</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">emittedEvents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$events</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Our infrastructure must then trigger event handlers, based
on the event names. It will use <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dequeueEmittedEvents</span></span> and making
sure the events are not emitted multiple times.</p>
<p>For reasons described below, we want the following command/event chain to happen in our system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Command executes</li>
<li>Entities emit events</li>
<li>Command transaction succeeds</li>
<li>Events trigger event handlers</li>
<li>Event handlers execute more commands</li>
<li>Restart from 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this approach we can decouple all services from each other and avoid
deep nesting in each other. Yet we still have transactional dependencies,
by dropping all events when the parent command fails. Transactions over
multiple commands will not have ACID properties though, instead you will have
to look into <a class="reference external" href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1394128">BASE transactions</a>
that are important in systems with eventual consistency. This is one downside
that you need to take into account.</p>
<p>The Domain Event pattern is a prerequisite for full blown <a class="reference external" href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1394128">CQRS</a>. My <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/litecqrs-php">LiteCQRS</a> library includes a simple
implementation of DomainEvent and EventProvider classes and integration into
Symfony and Doctrine ORM. Generally this pattern is very easy to implement
though, so that you can just have a look at the implementation and take the
best parts for your own.</p>

<h1><a href="2012/08/22/building_an_object_model__no_setters_allowed.html">Building an Object Model: No setters allowed</a></h1>
<p>If you are using an object relational mapper or any other database
abstraction technology that converts rows to objects, then you will probably
use getter/setter methods or properties (C#) to encapsulate object properties.</p>
<p>Take <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/blob/master/Model/User.php">a look</a>
at the default <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">User</span></span> entity from the Symfony2 FOSUserBundle plugin for
example: A colossus of getter/setter methods with nearly no real business
logic. This is how most of our persistence related objects look like in PHP.
A Rails ActiveRecord such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/master/app/models/issue.rb">Redmines “Issue”</a> avoids
the explicit getter/setters, however generates accessors magically for you.
Nevertheless you have to add considerable amount of code to configure all the
properties. And code using these active records becomes ambiguous as well.</p>
<p>Why do we use getters/setters so much?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tools generate objects from a database, adding getters and setters
automatically.</li>
<li>Frameworks make them automatically available for database records/rows.</li>
<li>IDEs can magically create getter/setter pairs for fields.</li>
<li>We want the flexibility to change every field whenever we want.</li>
<li>It became natural in OOP to have write access to every field.</li>
</ul>
<p>However Getters/setters <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">violate the open/closed principle</a>, prevent information
hiding and <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/565095/are-getters-and-setters-evil">should be considered evil</a>
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html">Long version</a>). Using
getters and setters allows to <em>decouples</em> the business logic for setting values from the
actual storage. Something that object-orientation was suppose to avoid.</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-rid-of-setters">
<h2>Getting rid of setters</h2>
<p>Avoiding setters is much simpler than getters, so lets start with them.</p>
<p>One way to avoid writing setters is a task based approach to the model. Think
of every task that is performed in an application and add a method that
changes all the affected fields at once, to perform this task. In the famous
blog example the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Post</span></span> object may look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$headline</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">array</span> <span class="nv">$tags</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// check invariants, business logic, filters</span>

        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">headline</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$headline</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">text</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$text</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">tags</span>     <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$tags</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">publish</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">\DateTime</span> <span class="nv">$onDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">null</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// check invariants, business logic, filters</span>

        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">state</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;published&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">publishDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$onDate</span> <span class="o">?:</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">\DateTime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;now&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Post</span></span> class is now much more protected from the outside and
is actually much better to read and understand. You can clearly see
the behaviors that exist on this object. In the future you might even
be able to change the state of this object without breaking client code.</p>
<p>You could even call this code domain driven, but actually its just applying
the SOLID principles to entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tackling-getters">
<h2>Tackling getters</h2>
<p>Avoiding getters is a bit more cumbersome and given no setters, maybe
not worth the trouble anymore.</p>
<p>You still need getters to access the object state, either if you display
models directly in the view or for testing purposes. There is another way
to get rid of all the getters that you don’t need explicitly in a domain
model, using the visitor pattern in combination with view models:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">PostView</span> <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">id</span>          <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">publishDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">publishDate</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">headline</span>    <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">headline</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">text</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">text</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">author</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">author</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">AuthorView</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$view</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PostView</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$id</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="c1">//... more public properties</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are drawbacks with this approach though:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why use the Post model in memory, when you are only passing <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PostView</span></span>
instances to the controllers and views only anyways? Its much more efficient
to have the database map to the view objects directly. This is what CQRS
postulates as separation of read- and write model.</li>
<li>You have to write additional classes for every entity (Data transfer objects)
instead of passing the entities directly to the view. But if you want to
cleanly separate the model from the application/framework, you don’t get
around view model/data transfer objects anyways.</li>
<li>It looks awkward in tests at first, but you can write some custom assertions
to get your sanity back for this task.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-the-automagic-form-mapping">
<h2>What about the automagic form mapping?</h2>
<p>Some form frameworks like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony.com">Symfony2</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend
Framework 2</a> ones map forms directly to objects
and back. Without getters/setters this is obviously not possible anymore.
However if you are decoupling the model from the framework, then using this
kind of form framework on entities is a huge no go anyways.</p>
<p>Think back to the tasks we are performing on our <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Post</span></span> entity:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edit (title, body, tags)</li>
<li>Publish (publishDate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both tasks allow only a subset of the properties to be modified. For each of
these tasks we need a custom form “model”. Think of these models as command
objects:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EditPostCommand</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$id</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$headline</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$text</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In our application we could attach these form models to our form framework and
then pass these as commands into our “real model” through a service layer,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/MessageBus.html">message bus</a> or something equivalent:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<p>This way we separated the business model from the application framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-word-about-rad">
<h2>A word about RAD</h2>
<p>Rapid-application development or rapid prototyping is a wide-spread approach in web
development. My explicit approach seems to be completely against this kind of
development and much slower as well. But I think you don’t loose much time
in the long run:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Simple command objects can be code-generated or generated by IDEs
in a matter of seconds. Or you could even extend ORMs code generation
capabilities to generate these dummy objects for you. Since you don’t need
ORM mapping information for these objects or think about performance
implications in context with the ORM, you don’t need to spend much
thinking about their creation.</li>
<li>Explicit models are much simpler to unit-test and those tests run much faster
than tests through the UI that RAD prototypes need.</li>
<li>Generated Rapid prototypes can get hard to maintain quickly. That does not mean they
are unmaintainable, but they seem to favour reimplementation instead of
refactoring, something that leads to problems given the low code coverage
that these prototypes normally have.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If we take a step back from all our tools suggesting to generate getter/setters
we find that there is a simple way to avoid using setters when focusing on the
tasks that objects perform. This actually makes our code much more readable and
is one building block towards clean object oriented code and domain driven design.</p>
<p>I am very interested in your opinions on this topic and my attempt to avoid them,

</ul>
<p>The last pattern for designing your business logic is called
“Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation” or short CQRS. It has its roots in
the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation">“Command Query Separation”</a> principle that was
put forward by Bertrand Meyer.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a very good summary about what this principle is about:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Command-Query-Separation states that every method should either be a
command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the
caller, but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change
the answer. More formally, methods should return a value only if they are
referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>CQRS is an OOP architecture design pattern building on that imperative
principle.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There are many different variations of the CQRS pattern that
all have their place. This post describes a simple variant that does
<strong>not</strong>
use Messaging, DomainEvent or EventSourcing patterns, which are commonly mentioned
with CQRS.</p>
</div>
<p>At its heart is the separation of Read and Write methods. This can be easily
achieved by just having two different service layer classes instead of one.
This insight alone is not really helpful, its just moving methods around.
Coupled to this change however is the notion, that read and write models don’t
necessarily have to be the same:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getter/Setters: We don’t need setters in the write model, instead we use
explicit methods for each write operation. Entities are also much simpler
without bi-directional relationships that read/write models often need.
Read-only models (ViewModel) don’t need getters/setters. They could just use
public properties or even be arrays.</li>
<li>ORM Performance, Lazy Loading and Query Restrictions: In a write scenario we
mostly need queries by primary key, changing only some objects. In
read scenarios we need complex queries, joins and aggregations. A separation
prevents both from affecting each other negatively.</li>
<li>Mapping Data-Transfer objects becomes simple. Instead of sending the whole
model back and forth, for the write scenario you define use-case specific
tasks and updates. This is much simpler than generic mapping of Data Transfer
objects to complex object graphs.</li>
<li>Transforming SQL directly to a view model in a highly optimized way.
Simple concept, but it has huge implications: A pure read-only model is simple to
maintain and refactor for any performance requirements that come up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore with CQRS our write service methods are not allowed to return data
anymore (With the exceptions to the rule of course). This may increase the
complexity at first, but it has benefits for scalability and decoupling.
Following this principle allows us to turn every command from synchronous to
asynchronous processing later without much problems. Services are allowed to
throw exceptions and refuse the execution. Proper validation of input data
should happen before executing write operations though.</p>
<p>One drawback of CQRS: A naive implementation doubles the amount of classes and
services to write. But there are simple shortcuts to avoid having to write a
full blown read-model if you don’t apply CQRS religiously:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Don’t use different data-stores for both models.</li>
<li>Mapping SQL to PHP arrays and stdClass objects through a simple gateway is
very simple. You can easily generalize this to a simple object that gives
efficient access to all your data.</li>
<li>Share parts of the write and read models if you don’t have to compromise
much.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to take away from this separation is, that the read part of
your application is seldom the part where business value lies in. Moving this
code into a different part of your applications allows you to work with the
underlying data-source much more directly, without need for much abstractions.</p>
<p>One thing that CQRS puts forward is the concept of Commands, Command Handlers
and Command Bus and how they interact. Commands are simple objects that
contain all the data necessary to execute an operation. Each command is
processed by exactly one command handler. The Command Bus is responsible to
route a command to its appropriate command handler.</p>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is the most simple implementation of the Command Bus, just holds a hash map
mapping command class names to command handlers:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">CommandBus</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$handlers</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$commandClassName</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span> <span class="nv">$handler</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">handlers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">$commandClassName</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$handler</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In your code you would always pass Commands to the bus. That way the command
bus is a central entry point to any write operation. With this we can rewrite the
TransferMoney service:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TransferMoneyCommand</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$sourceId</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$destinationId</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyTransfer</span> <span class="k">implements</span> <span class="nx">Handler</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$accountDao</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// ctor omitted</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$source</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">accountDao</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">sourceId</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$destination</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">accountDao</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">destinationId</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$money</span>       <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Money</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$command</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">amount</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="nv">$source</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">withdraw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$destination</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">deposit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$money</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There is also a benefit from the mental model of commands compared to the
“generic” term of model requests in EBI. Your write model gets task
oriented.</p>
<p>Routing everything through the command bus has several benefits as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nesting handlers that take care of transactions, logging, 2 phase commits</li>
<li>Order nested command calls sequentially instead of deep into each other.</li>
<li>Asynchronous processing with message queue become an option</li>
</ul>
<p>The command bus acts as the application boundary as described in the
Entity-Boundary-Interactor pattern, usage is simple:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyController</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">transferAction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Request</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>I really like CQRS for multiple reasons. It offers explicit guidance how solve
tasks by making use of a range of different design patterns. This is very
helpful, because the code-base is based on conventions that are simple to
understand by everyone on the team. This structure liberates you from the curse
of choice and gives you a cookbook of best-practices how to solve problems.
You want this structure for all your applications, regardless of what
architectural pattern you have chosen.</p>
<p>Embracing the difference between read and write models is another plus of CQRS.
It is very helpful, not to try fitting both read and write into one model.  You
also don’t run into so many read-related problems with an ORM any more. You
design the entities to be optimized for the write model only, loose the
bidirectional associations and avoid all the optimizations here and there for
read performance.</p>
<p>Compared to EBI, where we had to maintain a mapping between DTOs and entities,
CQRS explicitly uses the command based approach to avoid the complexity of
these mappings. You will still have to map between command and entity, however
doing so in the context of a use-case simplifies the code considerably compared
to a generic mapping solution.</p>
<p>One negative point: Its difficult to work with commands not returning any data
in some cases. You need to find simple ways to return messages to the
user. For that you also need to validate commands on the “client” or
controller side, using the read model, so that you can prevent invalid/illegal
commands from being sent as often as possible.</p>
<p>Without return values from your models, you are left to using mocks as means of
testing. This might be more difficult for developers to use and understand.
This problem goes away however, if you combine CQRS with Event Sourcing. A
topic that I will discuss in the next blog post.</p>

</ul>
<p>The next design pattern for technical system design is called “Data, Context,
Interaction”. It’s inventors Trygve Reenskaug and James Coplien call it a new
paradigm, in the context of PHPs language constraints it can be classified as
architectural design pattern. I came across this pattern through <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/go_oh">Gordon Oheim</a>. He has also invested quite some time going
through the book on DCI and trying to understand this pattern with me.</p>
<p>As in the EBI pattern, DCI separates data objects (Data) from behavior implemented
in use-cases (Context). Data objects are never directly involved in these
use-cases, but are “casted” to their respective roles that they are taking in
the use-case. This can be implemented with aggregation or traits in PHP.</p>
<p>One goal of DCI is to get object-oriented programming to a place, where you
can look at a use-case and its roles and be very sure that the program is
running correctly, because you can guarantee that there are no unexpected side
effects. It also aims at keeping the amount of code required to keep in mind
for a given use-case as small as possible, allowing developers to reason about
the code with more confidence.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>In DCI, <strong>data</strong> are objects that encapsulate the state of the application.
As in EBI, they only contain logic that is true for all the possible use-cases.
These classes represent <em>what the system is</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Roles</strong> and <strong>Context</strong> represent <em>what the system does</em> and are supposed to
capture the End User’s Mental Model as close as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Roles</strong> add behavior to the data objects by either wrapping them or
acting as traits for the data objects.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong> is the use-case and fulfils its role by making roles <strong>interact</strong> with
each other. These roles then modify the underlying data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Starting from the bank account example of the EBI post, we can introduce DCI
quite easily by adding the missing concept of roles. In the use case of
transferring money that would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TransferMoneySource</li>
<li>TransferMoneySink (Destination)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do this by either introducing two interfaces and two concrete
implementations that accept the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BankAccount</span></span> as object to work on
or by building two traits. I will go down the route with traits, to show
one possible use-case for this new PHP 5.4 feature. The idea here is to
implement all the behavior necessary on a trait and then have simple dummy
objects using them in the tests for this use-case.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any checks for balances, credit limits or other things would also happen
here. The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">withdraw</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deposit</span></span>  on the data objects should be as
dumb as possible, so that their implementation does not cause any side-effects
on the execution of this use-case.</p>
<p>The bank account would then be modified to look:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankAccount</span>
<span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The use-case <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TransferMoney</span></span> would then be modified to create Roles instead
of Data objects from the DAO. This can be a bit tricky when you have multiple
data objects implementing the same role and you have no way of knowing which
underlying data object to pick. The binding of data objects to roles happens
in the use-case. The use-case needs a means to retrieve objects with certain
roles, which then access underlying data sources. To avoid that your use-cases
have to know about how to bind roles to data, you could use GUIDs in your
application and fetch all objects from one data store. Another way would be to
implement data access objects for roles, that then know how to retrieve their
corresponding data.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this is appealing, however don’t forget that we have
abstracted I/O completely here. There has to be code that deals with that part
of the system somewhere. However this again is not at the heart of all the DCI
examples out there, making it difficult to reason about the actual practical
implications.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ObjectStorage</span></span> here is a service (repository) that can find any
persistent data object by a global ID. This is necessary, because it
doesn’t actually matter what data object uses the necessary traits
for this use-case.</p>
<p>Again as in EBI, in a bigger system you would need to find some abstraction
layer that does this in a more generic way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When Gordon started showing me this pattern we were both puzzled as how
to actually implement this in the real world. Especially the concept
of binding roles to data objects still confuses us. Most notably why the use
of traits or aggregates should actually constitute a new programming paradigm
instead of just another way to do OOP.</p>
<p>In Scala casting data objects to roles is actually possible by binding traits
to objects at runtime. This is not possible in PHP however and has to be done
statically.</p>
<p>Compared to EBI, DCI focuses drastically on transaction script domain logic, by
suggesting to implement roles for every use-case for the sake of avoiding
side-effects. This is actually is very valuable lesson from this pattern.
Finding means to decrease the complexity of software is always a good thing.
And the explicit definition of this concept as <strong>roles</strong> is actually easy to
explain to other programmers.</p>
<p>One thing that is lacking in DCI is that there is no concrete mechanism to deal
with the boundary to other parts of the system. This is actually a step back
from EBI and I suggest using EBI pattern in combination with DCI to solve this.</p>
<p>The largest benefit from DCI (and its self proclaimed goal) is the mapping from
the users/customers mental model directly into the code by using Use-Cases and
Roles. The communication with the customer about behavior can exclusively focus
on the current context and its use-case. Mapping this behavior to actual data
can then be done in a different step.</p>
<p>This simplification of use-cases and reduction of side-effects between
different parts of the system has other benefits: It can lead to easier to test
code and makes it much easier for developers to develop on small and isolated
parts of the system.</p>

</ul>
<p>Continuing the series, I will talk about Entity, Boundary and Interactor (EBI)
an architectural design pattern. I first heard about it in a keynote video of
<a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc">Uncle Bob</a> on Ruby
Midwest called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">“The lost years of architecture”</a>.
This is also described as <a class="reference external" href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal architecture</a> or “Ports and Adapters”
by Alistair Cockburn.</p>
<p>In this pattern any client of the system talks to the model using a model
request object and receives data from the model in form of model responses objects.
Additionally when your model talks to any kind of persistence or subsystem it
should go through an adapter that is replaceable. For a model architecture
designed this way, you can replace any part of the UI oder lower layers by
writing new adapters and plug them in.</p>
<div class="section" id="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>To iterate the terminology:</p>
<p><strong>Entities</strong> are objects that represent the system data of the application. They don’t contain
much logic except rules that are set in stone and are never going to change
(based on physic or mathematical laws or something).</p>
<p><strong>Interactors</strong> are use-case objects, they contain the business logic that is valid
in the current use-case and works with entities to fulfil their task.</p>
<p>The <strong>boundary</strong> is responsible for translating model request/response into a
format that the UI or actor can understand. They also mediate between model
and lower levels, for example to manage database transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-example">
<h2>An example</h2>
<p>Lets start with an example in PHP code. We will keep using a common example
throughout all blog posts, the usual Bank Account/Money Transfer. The use case
is the money transfer from one bank account (source) to another one
(destination).</p>
<p>We start by implementing the entity <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BankAccount</span></span>:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankAccount</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$balance</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is straightforward to implement the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">withdraw</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deposit</span></span>
functionality. The Money object implementation is omitted here.</p>
<p>The Interactor handles the use-case of transferring money from the
source to the destination account:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MoneyTransferRequest</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MoneyTransferResponse</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MoneyTransferRequest</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MoneyTransferResponse</span></span> objects are dumb
php objects (so called data-transfer objects, DTO).</p>
<p>You can see in the example that we use a Data Access object to retrieve the
source and destination account entities from some storage subsystem. To follow the EBI
design pattern, we have to decouple this data access object from the model,
by offering a port (Interface):</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">interface</span> <span class="nx">AccountDaoInterface</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$accountId</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This way our business logic is storage independent.</p>
<p>An example for a boundary would be the requirement for a transaction in
the bank account sample. We need to wrap the whole MoneyTransfer use-case in
a transaction. Lets say the invocation of our Use-Case is controlled through
some kind of application boundary object:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">BankApplicationBoundary</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$applicationFactory</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">transferMoney</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">MoneyTransferRequest</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">applicationFactory</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">createConnection</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">beginTransaction</span><span class="p">();</span>

        <span class="k">try</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nv">$useCase</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MoneyTransfer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$factory</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">createAccountDao</span><span class="p">());</span>
            <span class="nv">$result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$useCase</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">transferMoney</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">commit</span><span class="p">();</span>

            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$result</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">\Exception</span> <span class="nv">$e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">rollback</span><span class="p">();</span>
            <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="nv">$e</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is a very elaborate way to describe that calling the transfer money
use-case is wrapped in a Transaction, another port for the storage system to
manage transactions in this case. The code here is very explicit about
the actual task. In a real application you would probably find a more
generic approach to getting this job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boundary-abstraction">
<h2>Boundary Abstraction</h2>
<p>Thinking about the boundaries I came up with a library several month ago called
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei/context">Context</a>, which I deprecated already
(Reason below).  It allows you to wrap calls to the model by some sort of proxy
that transforms the request and response and also handles transactions and
such. Loosely spoken this was actually some kind of AOP library, using the
limited ways that PHP provides to implement AOP (magic <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call</span></span> proxies).</p>
<p>With context you would do something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="nv">$context</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">getContext</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// 1. direct invocation</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MyService</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nv">$context</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'service'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$myService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'method'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'doSomething'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'arguments'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$args</span><span class="p">));</span>

<span class="c1">// 2. proxy wrapping</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$context</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">MyService</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="nv">$myService</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$args</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The second way is obviously way more readable, but its also rather magic.</p>
<p>I deprecated this library because in the end it wasn’t really helpful that
much. Implementing an application specific proxy for services is done in
almost no time and then it solves all your specific needs. My main problem with
the library is that it tries to magically take away the need to design the
boundary of your application yourself - in a way that is not really coherent to
other developers.</p>
<p>In my own current greenfield applications I quickly went away from using it,
since a custom application proxy as shown in this
<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/3272909">Gist</a> is really much simpler to implement and
use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-with-symfony2">
<h2>Using with Symfony2</h2>
<p>As I am currently exclusively developing Symfony2/Silex applications, applying
EBI to Symfony2 framework based applications is very important to me. The
biggest difficulty here is the Form layer, especially the request data-mapping and
validation concerns, which are normally part of the model. There are two
approaches I came up with to solve this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build Forms for arrays or DTOs and send them through to the boundary to the model.
You have to validate the data again on the model, which is annoying, but in
this case the clean way. This is not so easy to do with complex forms though
as you need to map the request objects to your entities.</li>
<li>Create a Model Request that wraps and hides the form behind a simple data
mapping API. This way you can make it look as if you would map a DTO onto
an object, but in this case you are using the Form API as the mapper.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-php"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyService</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">edit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">EditRequest</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$entity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">dao</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">dataMapper</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The problem with this approach is, that you cant really unit-test these methods
anymore, because the complexity of the form layer mapping cannot be mocked with
this API. Instead your tests always need the full form layer (with validation,
depending services etc.) to allow for real-world testing. Additionally you have
to make the DataMapper throw an exception that you can catch in the controller,
rendering the appropriate response. Using exceptions for controlling executions
paths is not a very good practice though.</p>
<p>Another thing that actually helped was the SensioFrameworkExtraBundle and
ParamConverters. In my project I now have the framework building the Model
Request objects by convention from the HTTP Request, so that I only need to
pass them on and can skip the actual mapping of HTTP Request to Model Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons">
<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>This design pattern very closely resembles what Fowler calls <strong>Service Layer</strong>
pattern in PoEAA. EBI is going a bit more into detail by naming individual
parts of the pattern more explicit. Without more restrictions however using
this pattern will drive you towards many of the problems described in my
previous post.</p>
<p>Clean separation from frameworks is achieved, depending on the actual usage
however only at a significant cost.  Never forget stepping back and thinking
about further abstractions, otherwise applying EBI is leading to lots of code
being manually written.</p>
<p>This already shows one particular annoyance are the data-transfer objects. You
need to invest quite some work to get a mapping working from entities to
transfer objects and back. In the process you will loose the convenience of
“Open Entity Manager in the View”, where you can lazy load any
data you want to access in the view. This is quite a painful step, because you
are loosing lots of flexibility. Much more annoying is the need to update
entities from data-transfer objects, requiring sophisticated code for merging
of partial object graphs.</p>
<p>What this design pattern improves is the testability of code and also the
execution of tests is MUCH better, when you don’t have to go through the whole
application stack to test something.</p>
<p>Implementing behavior into the use-cases also avoids lots of lasagna code
compared to a messy domain driven design. You get a very good overview of
what is actually happening just by looking at the Model Request and Interactor
classes. However depending on the use-case the classes can get very big
and might need lots of collaborators, which make the problem complex again.</p>
<p>It is important to note that aggregating the domain logic in the use-cases
actually means going to some sort of transaction script processing, away from
domain driven design. I am pretty sure that this is not necessarily the
intention of this design pattern from a POV of Uncle Bob. However depending on
the sophistication of the applications domain logic, transaction script is
actually a very good pattern for simple to medium complex use-cases and
I like to have this as a general rule for developers (“Put behavior on the
use-case”).</p>
<p>In conclusion I can partially recommend using the EBI pattern. You have to be
careful to find abstraction layers that keep your code DRY and SOLID however,
something which does not come naturally with this pattern. If you are not
careful you end up with all the “messy points” that I mentioned in my previous
blog post.</p>
<p>You should be especially careful to avoid lots of DTO &lt;-&gt; Entity Mapping code
by using some code-generation for example to do parts of this job for you. The
worst outcome with this pattern is, when you manually code layers for HTTP
Request/Form =&gt; DTO =&gt; Entity mapping and the other way around.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">tl;dr Version: I present a list of problems with OOP business applications from
my personal experience and then introduce 3 approaches that I was put in
contact with over the last year, DCI, EBI and CQRS. This post is an
introduction to a series about this approaches.</p>
</div>
<p>I mentally divide the world of programming into two large parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Library and system programming</li>
<li>business applications</li>
</ol>
<p>The first produces code solving technical problems, often in a beautiful and
dedicated way. The second regularly produces mess, hopefully still
serving customers by optimizing their business. This differentiation is an
exaggeration, but from my experience its far easier to run a greenfield business
project into the ground than a new library.</p>
<p>There has to be a reason why so many programmers dedicate much free time to
open source projects. It might be empirical prove, that all our business
projects don’t make us happy at the end of the day and we have to show
ourselves that we can do better.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing business applications more than libraries, but they are also
much more difficult to get right in both social and technical dimensions.  One
motivational driver of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/beberlei">my open source activities</a> always was to simplify the technical dimension
of OOP business applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="my-personal-list-of-annoyances">
<h2>My Personal List of Annoyances</h2>
<p>This blog post is not about blaming customers (as the usual suspect), its about
finding the problems in usual OOP code of business systems from my experience
with PHP projects. To keep things short, I will list my <em>personal</em> list of
technical annoyances in business projects in no particular order. These are
highly subjective points.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getter/Setter Madness of Objects that are used to store data into
databases. Leading to huge objects that are essentially just meaningless
stores of data.</li>
<li>Updating complex object graphs from user input.</li>
<li>Separation of model, controller and views, especially when dealing with
forms. This is very complicated to achieve.</li>
<li>Lazy Loading and Query performance problems when using an ORM. Additionally
replacing parts of the views with hand-crafted SQL is often difficult and/or
time intensive, when already using an ORM.</li>
<li>Inability to decouple code that was written with CRUD (generators and
utilities) in mind towards more domain driven code, when the requirements
change.</li>
<li>Dependency mess leading to hard to test code, generally leading to untested
applications. Too often frameworks create huge dependencies that
make your domain model messy and complex to mock in tests.</li>
<li>Focus on synchronous request/response handling makes later usage of message
queues very complicated and expensive to refactor towards.</li>
<li>Tight coupling of model against the framework code.</li>
<li>Junior developers have too much freedom, when there is not much structure in
the code, but rather just a big ball of mud. Additionally with the tight
coupling of so many components, junior developers get easily lost in the code
and produce unexpected side-effects.</li>
<li>Use-cases easily span more than 5 classes. To grasp the interaction you have
to keep lots of code in your head, especially complicated for junior
developers again. As they cannot really work on a problem in isolation.</li>
<li>Constant violations of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a> principles
due to framework or persistence requirements.</li>
<li>Compared to library development, user-facing applications often have much
higher coupling between classes and namespaces. In libraries its often easy
to find different concerns, but in applications they seem hard to divide for
developers.</li>
<li>In combination with a rich javascript client, requirements to update objects
through their CRUD API produces concurrency and lost-update hell, that
dynamic server-side applications could mostly avoid before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially if you work in a tight schedule, project based environment where
the decision makers sell rapid application development and prototyping, then you
often have only one, maybe one and a half attempts to get the big picture
right. From that moment on you have to build on that decision and hope for the
best.</p>
<p>We have tried not to go the RAD+CRUD tools ways in several projects, to escape
the problems listed above. But without changes in your mindest you end up with
hand written mess, compared to getting there with tools.</p>
<p>Specifically <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven Design</a> applied naively can make
the problem even worse. It easily leads to lasagna code, where you have layers
of layers that are very hard to understand. Personally I prefer spaghetti code
over lasagna code, because its comparatively simpler to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-new-approaches">
<h2>Finding new Approaches</h2>
<p>Rather than to embrace the suck and dive deeper into CRUD architectures, I felt
there has to be some solution to organize business models structurally to avoid
all (or most) of these problems. In the PHP world with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony.com">Symfony2</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org">Doctrine2</a>
you have a powerful toolbox to avoid many of the problems above, but it is
still not simple to write clean object oriented applications.</p>
<p>After years of participation in both open source projects I still feel there is
a missing puzzle piece, to reach a clean separation of all the model concerns
from framework and persistence.</p>
<p>At some point I would really like to close the gap between desired technical
state of a project and the state it is actually in. I know there is no size
fits all solution, but I fell a checklist of architectural patterns with pro
and con arguments allows me to adjust the expectations about how a system looks
in the end.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/go_oh">Gordon</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/spriebsch">Stefan</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/tom_noise">Thomas</a>
I was introduced to several approaches to OO application design that I
started to explore in the past last months:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction">Data, Context, Interaction (DCI)</a> - which Gordon
studied a lot</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Entity, Boundary, Interactor (EBI)</a>, also called Hexagonal
architecture or “Ports and adapters”. Gained popularity after <a class="reference external" href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">Uncle Bobs talk
at Ruby Midwest</a>
last year.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation">Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation (CQRS)</a> well described in a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs">blog post by Udi Dahan</a> and in a hands on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.viddler.com/v/dc528842">one
day video class</a> by Greg Young.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not new and have all been around for several years already. I would
describe all three of them as architectural design patterns, though some people
might probably disagree with this classification. All three approaches make
you think about application development beyond just “service layers” in
radically new ways. All three have helped me rethink business applications in
different ways.</p>
<p>In the next weeks I will talk about each of these approaches individually, show
some examples and then wrap up my thoughts about all of them.</p>

<h1><a href="2012/06/03/setting_up_development_machines_with_puppet.html">Setting up Development Machines with Puppet</a></h1>
<p>I wrote <a class="reference external" href="/2012/05/31/virtual_machines_with_vagrant__veewee_and_puppet.html">about Vagrant</a> last week and
mentioned to talk about <a class="reference external" href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a> in the future. Before I will
dive into Puppet in combination with Vagrant I want to share my general
experiences with Puppet (beginners level, I just played with this today).</p>
<p>Puppet is a configuration management tool. It uses a declarative language to
describe how a system should look like. Upon invocation of puppet it attempts
to get the system from its current state into the desired state by installing
packages, executing programs/scripts and creating files/directories.</p>
<p>My laptop was still on Ubuntu 10.04 this morning, but for <a class="reference external" href="http://live.symfony.com">Symfony Live</a> I needed to upgrade to 12.04. This was necessary to
run a Virtualbox VM on my laptop that I built on my 12.04 desktop. Additionally
I really like the Unity desktop and wanted to get away from the Gnome that is
in 10.04.</p>
<p>After a backup and fresh installation of Ubuntu I realized how many things I
have to install to get this machine productive:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>LAMP stack + a bunch of other databases and services</li>
<li>Git, Svn, Hg, ..</li>
<li>Virtualbox + Vagrant</li>
<li>Vim with my Dot-Files, including Command-T which requires compilation,
and a bunch of development tools such as tree, ack-grep.</li>
<li>PHP Tools (PHPUnit, PHPCS, Xdebug, Xhprof)</li>
<li>Git with Author Information and global ignore file</li>
<li>A bunch of .bashrc initializations</li>
<li>Some open source projects I always have around (Doctrine, ...)</li>
<li>Setup automatic backup with my cloud storage provider (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.free-hidrive.com">Strato Hidrive</a> - they support rsync)</li>
<li>and I probably forgot a bunch of tools just thinking about this today.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized not only virtual machines, but also their hosts (my development
machines) could be automatically setup with Puppet.</p>
<p>So instead of saving my <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bash_history</span></span> to remember the steps I automated
them using Puppet. In Puppet you define Resources of several types, for example
Files, Packages or shell commands. You group these resources together in a
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pp</span></span> file and then invoke <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">puppet</span> <span class="pre">apply</span> <span class="pre">&lt;file&gt;.pp</span></span>. You can install Puppet
via <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span> <span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">puppet</span></span> on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The idea is to define Puppet resources in a way that they are performed once and
then the system has this resource. This means you can run puppet as often as
you want and it will only activate the missing resources.</p>
<p>I separate the installation process into two puppet files, one that has to be
run with root <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.puppet/devmachine-root.pp</span></span> and another one that has to be run with
my own user <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.puppet/devmachine.pp</span></span>.</p>
<p>Because every dev-machine setup is unique, I will just show some
examples of my puppet file to get the message across:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># /home/benny/.puppet/devmachine.pp

# VIM Dot Files
vcsrepo { 'vim-dotfiles':
    path     =&gt; &quot;/home/$id/.vim&quot;,
    ensure   =&gt; present,
    provider =&gt; git,
    source   =&gt; 'https://...'
}

file { 'vim-dotfiles-symlink':
    path   =&gt; &quot;/home/$id/.vimrc&quot;,
    ensure =&gt; link,
    target =&gt; '.vim/vimrc',
    require =&gt; Vcsrepo['vim-dotfiles']
}

exec { 'vim-make-command-t':
    command =&gt; 'rake make',
    cwd     =&gt; &quot;/home/$id/.vim/bundle/Command-T&quot;,
    unless  =&gt; &quot;ls -aFlh /home/$id/.vim/bundle/Command-T|grep 'command-t.recipe'&quot;,
    require =&gt; Vcsrepo['vim-dotfiles']
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The three keywords <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vcsrepo</span></span>, <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">file</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exec</span></span> are called types. They
define what functionality should be executed by puppet. Vcsrepo is a custom
type that you can grab <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-vcsrepo.git">from Github</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The first block uses Git to make sure that in my home directory the
<span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.vim</span></span> directory is a checkout of a given remote git repository.</li>
<li>The second file block makes sure that <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.vimrc</span></span> points to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.vim/vimrc</span></span>
using a symlink.</li>
<li>The third block compiles the Command-T VIM plugin. Inside the
exec block you can see the unless condition. This is necessary to prevent the
command from being executed whenever <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">devmachine.pp</span></span> is executed with
puppet. The require makes sure this resource is only activated after the dotfiles
were installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another nice example is the configuration of Git:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># Configure Git
exec { &quot;git-author-name&quot;:
    command =&gt; 'git config --global user.name &quot;Benjamin Eberlei&quot;',
    unless =&gt; &quot;git config --global --get user.name|grep 'Benjamin Eberlei'&quot;
}

exec { &quot;git-author-email&quot;:
    command =&gt; 'git config --global user.email &quot;kontakt@beberlei.de&quot;',
    unless =&gt; &quot;git config --global --get user.email|grep 'kontakt@beberlei.de'&quot;
}

exec { &quot;git-global-ignore&quot;:
    command =&gt; &quot;git config --global core.excludesfile /home/$id/.gitignore&quot;,
    unless  =&gt; 'git config -l --global|grep excludesfile'
}

file { &quot;git-global-ignorefile&quot;:
    path =&gt; &quot;/home/$id/.gitignore&quot;,
    ensure =&gt; present,
    content =&gt; &quot;*.swo\n*.swp\n&quot;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here A bunch of commands is executed unless some option is already set. At last
the global .gitingore is filled with the patterns of Vim temporary files.</p>
<p>I also automated all the other steps listed above, but will spare you the
details. For the LAMP Stack + PHP I used <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dietervds/puppet-symfony2">this following Github repository</a> as an inspiration. It ships a
set of Puppet Modules. You can just put them into your <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.puppet/modules</span></span>
folder and they are then available in any of your puppet files.</p>
<p>I can now reuse this on the different machines: desktop at home and at work and
my laptop. Whenever I install a new tool or change some configuration of my
system I can directly put this into puppet and keep the setup synchronized on
all the machines I work with.</p>
