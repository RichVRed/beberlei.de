About
=====

My name is Benjamin Eberlei and I have been operating this blog on and off
since 2005 (although not all posts survived, only those starting in 2008+). I
am a `programmer <https://github.com/beberlei>`_, `trainer and consultant
<https://qafoo.com>`_ and since recently also a `founder of the company
Tideways <https://tideways.io>`_. On this blog I write about programming,
software and other computer science related topics.

You can follow me on `Twitter <https://twitter.com>`_, subscribe to my `RSS
feed <http://beberlei.de/rss.xml>`_.
